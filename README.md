## About the project
The general aim of this research is to suggest the modelling pipeline with a supervised learning approach based on experiences of other researchers in the field of fraud detection. The other aim is to validate this method on real-world transaction data-sets. Last but not least, it is to check whether representing such data sets as graphs and adding their features to the learning process improves performance of the model
