## About the project
Although the number of transaction fraud events grows slower than the number
of transactions in total, it is still a problem for many institutions. Detecting
fraudulent transactions is challenging for multiple reasons, including a general
lack of labels, class imbalance, and hidden and evolving fraud patterns. Even
more difficulties emerge while modeling public transaction datasets, namely feature
anonymization, missing information, and data aggregation. This work suggests a
pipeline of modeling fraudulent transactions, which accounts for most of those
concerns based on other researchersâ€™ experience. From the modeling approaches,
one can distinguish those based on transaction features and those using graph
anomaly detection methods. This research combines both methods and presents
cross-validation results over two datasets. Performance scores did not indicate the
superior predictive power of any presented approach. Nevertheless, the addition of
graph features in the case of the second dataset significantly improved validation
scores and therefore indicated the direction for further research.
